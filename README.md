This is only a quick made proof of concept.
It is based on [this file](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_nRF52_Arduino/blob/master/libraries/Bluefruit52Lib/examples/Peripheral/custom_hrm/custom_hrm.ino)

## Hardware

We are using an [Adafruit Feather nRF52840 Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4062).

## Software

As this is a POC, we are using the Arduino/Adafruit libraries. Please follow [this link](https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-the-adafruit-nrf52840-feather/arduino-bsp-setup)
